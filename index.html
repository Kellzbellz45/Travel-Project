        The legend has it that Lisbon was named Olissipo by the Romans, for its
        resemblance to the Roman capital. Just like Rome, Lisbon began its life
        as a humble settlement nestled among seven hills. However, it wasn't
        until the 17th century, in the writing of Frey Nicolao d'Oliveira, that
        Lisbon came to be called 'a cidade das sete colinas' - the city of seven
        hills. You can still see traces of ancient Lisbon today. Beyond the
        array of shops with international brands, peaceful streetside cafes
        selling the iconic pastel de nata and world class restaurants with a
        variety of global cuisine, you can still wander the seven hills and see
        the city from above, taking in the rolling terracotta rooftops, the
        whitewashed walls and on the horizon, the soft blue sea.

              I have travelled to Asia, Europe and America. I grew up in Seattle
              and just moved to Portugal 6 months ago. I love coffee,
              sightseeing and making new friends while doing creative projects.
